# Natural Language Processing NLP

## Objective
This repo contains two notebooks written with the aim of web scrape information and perform some basic natural language processing (NLP) 
and statistical analysis of the Geophysics journal of Society of Exploration Geophysicists. 

Some of the basic steps are inspired from this [Data Camp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/fb-live-annoucement). Lots of 
tweaking and changes are however required to be able to web scrape what you want from the website you want, so do not expect anything to work 
out-of-the-box if trying to do similar stuff on another website.
